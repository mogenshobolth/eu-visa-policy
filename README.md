# Schengen visa project

The purpose of the Schengen visa project is to generate insights into the implementation of EUs common short-stay visa policy ('Schengen visa') and in turn position these findings in the wider debate on European migration policy and politics as well as EU implementation studies in general.

## Background 

The project builds upon my [PhD thesis](http://etheses.lse.ac.uk/551/) handed in at the [London School of Economics](https://www.lse.ac.uk). The thesis put in place a [European Visa Database](http://www.mogenshobolth.dk/evd/) (EVD) covering the period 2005-2012. Much has happened since then from a methodological perspective with the growth of Data Science as an independent discipline and the resulting diffusion of software enginnering tools and perspectives to other fields. This project hence also seeks to reconstruct this data using contemporary technologies.
